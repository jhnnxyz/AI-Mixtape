    "### Scalar\n",
    "A \"scalar\" is just a single number, like 4 or -17.3 or π. Why are single numbers called \"scalars\"? It’s because single numbers \"scale,\" or stretch, vectors and matrices without changing their direction. Scalars will be indicated with Greek lowercase letters such as `λ, α, γ` or lower case letters such as `a, b, c`. \n",

    "### Matrix\n",
    "A Matrix (plural Matrices) is a rectangular table of numbers or, more generally, a table consisting of abstract quantities that can be added and multiplied. Matrices are used to describe linear equa􏱙tions, keep track of the coefficients of linear transformations, and to record data that depend on two parameters. Matrices can be added, multiplied, and decomposed in various ways, making them a key concept in linear algebra and matrix theory.\n",

The dimensions of a matrix are always given with the number of rows first, then the number of columns. The entry of a matrix **A** that lies in the *i*-􏱙th row and the *j*-􏱙th column is called the (*i, j*)􏱙-th entry of A. This is written as A_i,j or A[i, j]. As is indicated, the row is always noted first, then the column.\n",
